👋 Hi, I’m @KozmikLojik, an enthusiast orbiting the intersection of tech, space, and powerful AI, driven by the goal of building truly cool, futuristic stuff—from simulating digital dream palaces to designing advanced ship systems for deep space exploration. I'm currently leveling up my skills in Computer Science and AI, specifically focusing on how they can unlock the next era of cosmic discovery. I'm always looking to collaborate on creative tech projects, story-driven games, or anything that pushes the boundaries of the future. If you want to talk code, space opera, or the brilliance of Tomb Raider (a certified masterpiece!), feel free to DM me on GitHub!
