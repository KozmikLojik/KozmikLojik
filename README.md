## 🚀 KOZMIKLOJIK: Mission Profile

# **KOZMIKLOJIK**

👋 Hi, I’m **@KozmikLojik**, an enthusiast orbiting the intersection of **tech, space, and powerful AI**, driven by the goal of building truly cool, futuristic stuff—from simulating digital dream palaces to designing advanced ship systems for deep space exploration. I'm currently leveling up my skills in **Computer Science and AI**, specifically focusing on how they can unlock the next era of cosmic discovery. I'm always looking to collaborate on **creative tech projects, story-driven games, or anything that pushes the boundaries of the future**. If you want to talk code, space opera, or the brilliance of *Tomb Raider* (a certified masterpiece!), feel free to DM me on GitHub.
